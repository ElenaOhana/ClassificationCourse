      <p style="color: black; text-align: justify">Yoga has been studied and may be recommended to promote relaxation, reduce stress and improve some medical conditions such as premenstrual syndrome.[245] Yoga is considered to be a low-impact activity that can provide the same benefits as "any well-designed exercise program, increasing general health and stamina, reducing stress, and improving those conditions brought about by sedentary lifestyles". It is particularly promoted as a physical therapy routine, and as a regimen to strengthen and balance all parts of the body.[245]

Yoga may improve psychological health during cancer treatment, although more evidence is needed to confirm this possible benefit.[20] Other research indicated that yoga could be a useful in addition to other treatments in schizophrenia,[21] and may have positive effects on mental health, although the quality of research to define these effects is low.[246]

In 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance. Yoga was one of 17 practices evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found.[247] Accordingly, In 2017 the Australian government named yoga as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would "ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence". <span style="background-color: blue">You can read the reaserch about yoga <a style="color: black" href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/the-science-of-yoga-what-new-research-reveals">right here</a></span></p>
